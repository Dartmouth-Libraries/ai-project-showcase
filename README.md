# ai.dartmouth.edu in Action: Showcasing Innovative Projects and Use Cases


Discover how AI.Dartmouth.edu is transforming research, education, and administration across campus in this showcase of projects and use cases. In this session, we’ll highlight applications like the AI Patient Actor, 44 Billion Moments of Joy, and the Finance Navigator, providing you with inspiration for future projects and support.

We’ll discuss the potential and appropriate use cases for AI.Dartmouth.edu, helping you understand how this platform can be leveraged in a variety of ways.

We'll explore strategies for integrating AI.Dartmouth.edu into teaching and research, ensuring that these tools are accessible and useful to a broader audience.

Finally, you will have an opportunity to build your own small application interacting with our Large Language Models!

## Contents

This repository contains all the materials for the workshop session, consisting of a slide deck in the directory `ppt`, and a collection of Jupyter notebooks with code demos in (`notebooks`)

## Getting Started
### Requirements

Some basic Python programming knowledge is required to fully understand the example code. Consider working through [Intro to Python](https://github.com/Dartmouth-Libraries/Intro-to-Python) and [Let there be Data! APIs in Python](https://github.com/Dartmouth-Libraries/apis-in-python) prior to this workshop.

The requirements for the Python code can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Access

The code in the example notebooks requires a valid Dartmouth API key. Some examples also require an OpenAI API key.

You can acquire these keys from the [Dartmouth Developer Portal](https://developer.dartmouth.edu) and the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/), respectively.

To use your keys in the code, follow these steps:

1. Create a text file called `.env` in the root directory of this repository.
2. Add the following lines to `.env`, replacing 'YOUR_KEY' with your actual key:
   ```
   DARTMOUTH_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
   ```
3. Save and close `.env`.

That's it - your keys are set up for use in the example notebooks.
